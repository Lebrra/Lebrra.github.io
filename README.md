# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Downloads all required apis referenced in package.json (If npm start doesn't work, do this).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm deploy`

Ref [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) for online instructions.

The only way I got this working was by running 'npm deploy' on the same branch I can locally test 'npm start' on, then finding the folder that matches my files in my personal Documents/WebsiteTemp (its something super long with !! in it)
