                        Online Party Game explains itself; it is a Mario Party-inspired online board game for 2-6 players. 
                        The game's current state is fairly simple, but we left a lot of room for additions and improvments coming this summer.

                        Using Wisconsin (below) as a reference, I wanted to challenge myself with another online game. 
                        With the foundation set, I plan on testing the limits of real-time online connectivity within the minigames.
