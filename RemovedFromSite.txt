                        Online Party Game explains itself; it is a Mario Party-inspired online board game for 2-6 players. 
                        The game's current state is fairly simple, but we left a lot of room for additions and improvments coming this summer.

                        Using Wisconsin (below) as a reference, I wanted to challenge myself with another online game. 
                        With the foundation set, I plan on testing the limits of real-time online connectivity within the minigames.

                        Wisconsin is an online card game based off my family card game called Michigan.
                        I created this project with my professor Dr. Nick Hwang to give my family a way to play their card game remotely during COVID-19.

                        Together we learned a lot about server integration in Unity. We plan on getting Wisconsin to app stores as soon as possible.

                        I created the enemy spawners, shop, and player upgrades. This was my first time working with mobile, and I would love to work on more!
