Steering Behaviors:

- General Notes - 

- By default, sheep are set to randomly rotate (50%) or go straight (50%).
- If the speed slider is set to 0, behaviors are disabled and sheep will stand still.
- Regardless of the selected behavior(s), the sheep will always detect collisions on walls and each other. 


- Mouse Behavior -

If a mouse is within the canvas, the sheep will go directly to the mouse position; this overrides all other steering behaviors.


- Steering Behaviors -

There are 5 different steering types when a mouse is not present. These can be adjusted using the four Sheep Behavior Distribution sliders, which add up to a max of 100% (5% increments). Any leftover percent goes to the Go Straight behavior. With these distributions, a behavior will be selected randomly weighted by the slider values.

1. Random Steering
Sheep hold a direction (1 or -1) value that has a 10% chance to swap whenever this behavior is selected. Using this direction, it randomly selects 0-10 degrees to rotate during this given frame. This gives a good amount of randomness without being too jittery.

2. Rotate to Neighbor
Sheep will rotate directly towards its closest found neighbor. This will cause lots of collisions within the herd.

3. Rotate with Neighbor
("alignment" steering) This is my take on the expected boid behavior; sheep will try to match their closest neighbor's direction. I did not calculate an average direction among the herd, but I could have here.

4. Avoid my Neighbor
("seperation" steering) Sheep will try to avoid their closest neighbor.

5. Go Straight
Simply goes straight; only applies velocity changes on collisions.
note: this behavior doesn't have its own slider - this is the remaining value leftover from the sliders (if not at 100% already)
