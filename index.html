        <div class="about">
            <p>
                I am currently wrapping up my final semester at <strong>University of Wisconsin - Whitewater</strong>,
                where I will be graduating with a BS in <br />
                <br />-<strong class="tall">Media Arts and Game Development: Communication/Gaming</strong>,
                <br />-<strong class="tall">Mathematics: Pure Mathematics</strong>, and
                <br />-<strong class="tall">Computer Science</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time in college, I have strived to gain as much experience as I was able. From interships, to study abroad (gone remote) projects, to numerous game jams,
                I love pushing my self to be a part of something great. I love video games, and I have always wanted to be the one behind a game that brings someone joy.
                <i>(Maybe more here?)</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently searching for a job in game programming. I'm hoping to stay around my home in Wisconsin, but I'm also open to anywhere in the US or remote work.
            </p>

                        I created the backend database that holds and chooses scenarios for any given run held in scriptable objects.
                        I also created the functionality of all player abilities, all UI functionality, and all the different menu systems.

                        This project was continued, won Best in Show at the 2020 UW-Whitewater MAGD Expo, and was submitted to IndieCade!

                        I created the mirror effect in the background of both player screens, as well as the functionality of the title menus.
                        I also created the endless mode, which is unlocked after getting all the collectibles in every level!

                        Escape from Valhalla was one of two projects created during a collaboration with UW-Whitewater and HAN University students.
                        Unfortunately, we were unable to travel to the Netherlands, and this project was completed entirely remotely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was one of two programming leads for this project; I was in charge of a team of five people from both universities.
                        My team was in charge of player mechanics and UI. <br /> I developed the menu systems and inventory. I also created a custom input manager to support multiple controller types.
