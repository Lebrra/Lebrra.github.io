        <div class="about">
            <p>
                I have just finished up my final semester at <strong>University of Wisconsin - Whitewater</strong>,
                where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in
                <br />&emsp;&emsp;-<strong class="tall">Media Arts and Game Development: Communication/Gaming</strong>,
                <br />&emsp;&emsp;-<strong class="tall">Mathematics: Pure Mathematics</strong>, and
                <br />&emsp;&emsp;-<strong class="tall">Computer Science</strong>.
                <br />I am proud to have been on the Dean's list every semester and to be graduating with a 3.9 GPA overall and within each major.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time in college, I have strived to gain as much experience as I was able. From interships, to study abroad (gone remote) projects, to numerous game jams,
                I love pushing my self to be a part of something great. I love video games, and I have always wanted to be the one behind a game that brings someone joy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently searching for a job in game programming. I'm hoping to stay around my home in Wisconsin, but I'm also open to anywhere in the US or remote work.

                        Online Party Game explains itself; it is a Mario Party-inspired online board game for 2-6 players. 
                        The game's current state is fairly simple, but we left a lot of room for additions and improvments coming this summer.

                    <p>
                        Using Wisconsin (below) as a reference, I wanted to challenge myself with another online game. 
                        With the foundation set, I plan on testing the limits of real-time online connectivity within the minigames.

                        Wisconsin is an online card game based off my family card game called Michigan.
                        I created this project with my professor Dr. Nick Hwang to give my family a way to play their card game remotely during COVID-19.

                    <p>
                        Together we learned a lot about server integration in Unity. We plan on getting Wisconsin to app stores as soon as possible.

                        I created the backend database that holds and chooses scenarios for any given run held in scriptable objects.
                        I also created the functionality of all player abilities, all UI functionality, and all the different menu systems.

                    <p>
                        Escape from Valhalla was one of two projects created during a collaboration with UW-Whitewater and HAN University students.
                        Unfortunately, we were unable to travel to the Netherlands, and this project was completed entirely remotely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was one of two programming leads for this project; I was in charge of a team of five people from both universities.
                        My team was in charge of player mechanics and UI. <br /> I developed the menu systems and inventory. I also created a custom input manager to support multiple controller types.
