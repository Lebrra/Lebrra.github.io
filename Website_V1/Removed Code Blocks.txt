                <p>
                	Spilt is a local co-op puzzle game created during a 48 hour game jam.
                        This project was continued, won Best in Show at the 2020 UW-Whitewater MAGD Expo, and was submitted to IndieCade!

                        I created the mirror effect in the background of both player screens, as well as the functionality of the title menus.
                        I also created the endless mode, which is unlocked after getting all the collectibles in every level!
